= What is ScalaCL ? =

Two things :
  * a [ScalaCLPlugin Scala compiler plugin] that optimizes general loops on arrays, lists and (inline) int ranges. For instance, the following code will run faster with [ScalaCLPlugin] :
{{{
for (i <- 0 to 10000)
  println(i)
}}}
  * a [ScalaCLCollections library of OpenCL-backed collections] that can run some of their operations directly on the GPU (mostly filter and map) :
{{{
import scalacl._
import scala.math._
implicit val context = new ScalaCLContext
val r = (0 to 1000000).cl // this is a CLRange
val a = r.toCLArray // this is a CLArray[Int]
val m = a.map(v => cos(v).toFloat) // run asynchronously on the GPU via OpenCL
println(m)
}}}

Please read [Usage] to know how to install/use ScalaCL in your projects.

= Why are ScalaCL Collections asynchronous ? What does it mean ? =

To the end user, [ScalaCLCollections] appear just as any other synchronous Scala collection. 

However, when you run `CLArray(1, 2, 3).map(_ + 1).map(_ * 2)`, the two map operations are not run synchronously. This means they might not have even been started yet !

The returned collection knows about which asynchronous operations are pending, and it will wait for them to complete if, say, you want to run `.toArray` on it.

= How do I know for sure that things worked well ? =

If you want to know what's happening (e.g. if there's an actual rewrite taking place during compilation or if the OpenCL collections actually schedule OpenCL kernels for execution), you can set the `SCALACL_VERBOSE` environment variable to `1` :
  * On Unix, Linux, MacOS X (bash) :
{{{
export SCALACL_VERBOSE=1
}}}
  * On Windows :
{{{
set SCALACL_VERBOSE=1
}}}

Also, you can ask `scalac` to show you the source after the [ScalaCLPlugin] transforms :
  * For general Scala collections transforms :
{{{
scalac Test.scala -Xprint:scalacl-loopstransform
}}}
  * For OpenCL collections transforms :
{{{
scalac Test.scala -Xprint:scalacl-functionstransform
}}}
