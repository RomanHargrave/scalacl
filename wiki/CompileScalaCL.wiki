[ScalaCLv1 ScalaCL v1] is [http://code.google.com/p/javacl/wiki/Build compiled as part of NativeLibs4Java's SVN trunk].

ScalaCL v2 (in development) relies on the BridJ port of JavaCL (+ on the latest BridJ version), which resides in a branch but needs the trunk BridJ version.

To build ScalaCL v2 :
  * Clone the [https://github.com/ochafik/nativelibs4java NativeLibs4Java Git tree] :
  {{{
git clone git://github.com/ochafik/nativelibs4java.git
cd nativelibs4java/libraries/OpenCL
}}}
  * Build ScalaCL Collections :
{{{
cd ScalaCL
mvn install
cd ..
}}}
  * Build ScalaCL Compiler Plugin (you can also use sbt, but not for tests : they currently only work with Maven) :
{{{
cd ScalaCLPlugin
mvn install -DskipTests
cd ..
}}}
