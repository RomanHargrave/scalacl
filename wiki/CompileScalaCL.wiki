#summary How to compile ScalaCL
#labels Featured

ScalaCL v1 is compiled as part of NativeLibs4Java's SVN trunk.

ScalaCL v2 (in development) relies on the BridJ port of JavaCL (+ on the latest BridJ version), which resides in a branch but needs the trunk BridJ version.

To build it :
  * [http://code.google.com/p/javacl/wiki/Build Build NativeLibs4Java's trunk projects] (needed to get the latest version of BridJ)
  * Checkout the OpenCL-BridJ branch and build it :
  {{{
svn checkout http://nativelibs4java.googlecode.com/svn/branches/OpenCL-BridJ/libraries nativelibs4javaBridJed
cd nativelibs4javaBridJed
cd OpenCL
mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

cd ScalaCL2
mvn install

cd ScalaCLPlugin
mvn install
}}}
